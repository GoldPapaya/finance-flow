Subject: Payment Reminder Hey Lucas! Hope you're having a good week. Just wanted to let you know that I sent over the fifty-five dollars and 50 cents (55.50 USD) for the concert tickets we got last month. The transaction went through yesterday, 11/21/2025. Thanks again, - Sarah. P.S. I owe you coffee next time!
